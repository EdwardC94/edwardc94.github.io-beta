<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>I am going to give my opinion on a topic that has been discussed a lot recently: cultural appropriation. This social phenomenon is very complex, but I will try to provide my own definition. Cultural appropriation is when an individual imitates an aspect of a culture they are not part of without having a solid understanding of the historical background of said aspect and its social impact throughout the time. This behavior is considered even less acceptable if the individual who practices it belongs to a social group that had oppressed other social groups in the past, even if it had not oppressed the social group they are imitating in particular.</p>

<p>At this point, I got to say it, I am very satisfied with the definition I came up with; the main reason for this is because it is not limited to describe isolated events covered by the media, to wit, white people wearing hair styles that black people call their own, but a wide variety of crimes against culture that happen all around the world all the time—and yes, you read that right, I said crimes against culture.
</p>

<h2>Why is it a crime against culture?</h2>

<p>Cultural appropriation is a crime against culture for two reasons. First, because it dilutes the meaningfulness of the symbols, traditions, costumes, and characteristics that a culture is made of. An example of this is Rock n' Roll; while it is true that this music genre resulted from the combination of various music styles created by black and white people alike, one of the biggest contributing factors to its creation was the development of the music styles practiced by enslaved black people. However, to this day Elvis Presley, a white male, is praised as the 'King of Rock n' Roll', and the terrible roots of Rock n' Roll are ignored by many.</p>

<p>Secondly, because it makes people forget about their origins, and deny them. This is even a worse crime than the former, because it is a crime against ourselves. Normally this happens to a lot of people who, in an effort to be accepted by a community, pay better attention to whatever costume or tradition is mainstream. An example of this is <i>El Día de Muertos</i> in Mexico. The once beautiful celebration of the dead has now been transformed into an Americanized version of what my ancestors used to do. On that day, many families would gather in the cemeteries to pay a visit to those who had passed away; on that day, many households would make their best effort to put together an <i>Ofrenda</i> so that their relatives in the afterlife had a place to find shelter and their favorite food for the one night that they were allowed to visit the Land of the living. Today, everything revolves around partying and candy.</p>

<h2>What makes this a problem?</h2>

<p>As with many things in life, I think that cultural appropriation is a problem derived by ignorance, intolerance, and a lack of cultural identity. This is mainly because the people who don't know better than to participate in this behavior are attacked rather than helped find the right way, and because we live in a society where more often than not people are criticized and ashamed for expressing their cultural background. I see this everyday; on the news, for example, we read about the discontent of the Black-American community toward white people for listening to hip-hop music, for wearing braided hair or for using their slang when they speak. This is specially true if they consider that the <i>offenders</i> are not supportive of the cause that promotes awareness against inequality among races.
</p>

<p>And we also see, specially in Mexico City, how people who speak a dialect, wear traditional clothing or have indigenous appereance are called <i>indios</i>.It is also very common to see how many people are discriminated against for being a darker shade of brown when the reality is that in Mexico a very low percentage of the population is white. The saddest part is that very few Mexicans feel proud of their heritage and choose to adopt American ways instead.</p>

<h2>And what is the solution?</h2>

<p>If I had the opportunity to get my message accross the Black-American community I would tell them this: Don't fight ignorance with hate, fight ignorance with education. If you see someone singing hip-hop, do not resort to violence, share with them the historical background of this music genre and the importance it has to you, relay a message of love and tolerance and many more people will get interested in your culture, not to appropriate it, but to celebrate it. For example, whenever I see American people eating Taco Bell and calling it Mexican food, I don't feel the need of pointing out the discrimination Mexicans face in the US, neither do I want to punch them in the face while shouting that Taco Bell is not really Mexican food. Instead, I feel the urgency of taking them to a <i>taquería</i> so that they can experience in their mouths the flavor of a true taco</p>

<p>With regard to the other side of this problem, I just want to advise anybody reading this long post to be more positive toward people who feel proud and happy about their background. It is also important to remember that we need to think twice about the words we use to describe someone, and that calling someone <i>indio</i> is not just wrong, but also really stupid. Lastly I also beg you, reader, to please celebrate your cultural identity, observe the traditions your ancestors are entrusting you, and to never ever feel ashamed of what makes 'you' you.</p>
