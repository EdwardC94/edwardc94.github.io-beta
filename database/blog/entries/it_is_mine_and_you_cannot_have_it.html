<p>I am going to give my opinion on a topic that has been discussed a lot recently: cultural appropriation. This social phenomenon is very complex, but I will try to provide my own definition. Cultural appropriation is when an individual imitates an aspect of a culture they are not part of without having a solid understanding of the historical background of said aspect and its social impact throughout the time. This behavior is considered even less acceptable if the individual who practices it belongs to a social group that had oppressed other social groups throughout the time, even if it had not oppressed the race they are imitating.</p>
<p>I got to say it, I am very satisfied with this definition; the main reason for this is because it is not limited to describe isolated events covered by the media, to wit, white people wearing hair styles that black people call their own, but a wide variety of cultural crimes that happen all around the world.</p>
