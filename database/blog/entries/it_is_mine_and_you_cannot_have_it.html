<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>I am going to give my opinion on a topic that has been discussed a lot recently: cultural appropriation. This social phenomenon is very complex, but I will try to provide my own definition. Cultural appropriation is when an individual imitates an aspect of a culture they are not part of without having a solid understanding of the historical background of said aspect and its social impact throughout the time. This behavior is considered even less acceptable if the individual who practices it belongs to a social group that had oppressed other social groups in the past, even if it had not oppressed the social group they are imitating in particular.</p>

<p>I got to say it, I am very satisfied with this definition; the main reason for this is because it is not limited to describe isolated events covered by the media, to wit, white people wearing hair styles that black people call their own, but a wide variety of crimes against culture that happen all around the world all the time—and yes, you read that right, I said crimes against culture.</p>

<h2>Why is it a crime against culture?</h2>

<p>Cultural appropriation is a crime against culture for two reasons. First, because it dilutes the meaningfulness of the symbols, traditions, costumes, and characteristics that a culture is made of. An example of this is Rock n' Roll; while it is true that this music genre resulted from the combination of various music styles created by black and white people alike, one of the biggest contributing factors to its creation was the development of the music styles practiced by enslaved black people. However, to this day Elvis Presley, a white male, is praised as the 'King of Rock n' Roll', and the terrible roots of Rock n' Roll are ignored by many.</p>

<p>Secondly, because it makes people forget about their origins, and deny them. This is even a worse crime than the former, because it is a crime against ourselves. Normally this happens to a lot of people who, in an effort to be accepted by a community, pay better attention to whatever costume or tradition is mainstream. An example of this is <i>El Día de Muertos</i> in Mexico. The once beautiful celebration of the dead has now transformed into an americanized version of what my ancestors used to do. On that day, many families would gather in the cementaries to pay a visit to those who had passed away; on that day, many people would make their best effort to put together an <i>Ofrenda</i> so that their relatives in the afterlife had a place to find shelter and their favorite food for the one night that they were allowed to visit the Land of the living. Today, everything revolves around partying and candy. A very tragic event, indeed.</p>
