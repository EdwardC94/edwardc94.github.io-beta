This movie is important because it introduces to the MCU one of the superheroes that The Avengers will need on their side to be able to fight Thanos. But not only that, the movie also confirms a theory that most fans have assumed. Read more about this theory on the article, but be warned, there will be major spoilers there.",

At one point of the sequel you will think to yourself that the movie should have been titled \"A series of unfortunate events\" instead. Let me name a few of the things that many fans will be missing in the upcoming adaptation to this beloved comic.",
