           ">Romance: <small>Something that will keep me awake at night for many nights to come</small></h1>

<p>It is two in the morning and my sleep is once more interrupted by the same fear. I am no toddler, so I am not scared of the monster under my bed, or worse, the monster hidden in the closet. I was able to overcome this fears when I turned 16. No, my fear belongs to this realm and is as real as my grandmother knocking on my door telling me that depriving myself from sleep is detrimental to my health. I think to myself, <i>You are awake, too, grandma, so stop patronizing me</i>. Besides, how could I possibly sleep if I am not able to think about anything else other than my biggest fear, to wit, to die without experiencing true romance.</p>

<p>As stupid as it sounds, I am genuinely preoccupied about this whole situation. It is well know that nobody has their time on earth guaranteed, so thinking that I might die at this very moment is as paranoid as it is realistic. There might be countless things that I have not yet experienced either that most people deem more important, but I think that romance is of utmost importance to me, because I grew up watching movies like <i>Pretty Woman</i> that always made me go like <strong>I want that</strong>; I want a man to offer me his arms, to offer me his heart, to offer me a lifetime of living together.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, more than once I have caught myself acknowledging that I am by no means as handsome as Sandra Bullock nor there are plenty enough attractive, rich, kind, single men for me to be lucky enough as to find at least one of them to make my definition of true romance real. So, how the heck I am supposed to find Mr. Romance?, I always ended up asking myself. Not long ago I was finally able to come up with the answer. If my chances of meeting that guy who will change my life forever are so low, why not increasing them by meeting as many guys as possible.</p>

<p>At first I thought that I was brilliant, that it was so obvious that not finding the answer before made me really stupid. However, I learned that "meeting as many guys as possible" comes at a very expensive price, having one's heart broken that many times. But if I have come this far I am not going to stop now, I know for sure that he is out there, and that I am going to find him. If I need to let my heart be broken in a thousand pieces, so be it. I know that when I meet him, it will all be worth it. In the meantime, I decided that I wanted to leave a record of all the men that have broken my heart thus far. It is said that if someone does not know history, they are bound to repeat it, so I am going to analyze everything, so that I can learn from my mistakes and grow wiser.</p>

<p>But now it's time to go to sleep. Who knows? Maybe I will meet Mr. Romance tomorrow.</p>
