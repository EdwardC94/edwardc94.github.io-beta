<h3>What lives within</h3>
<p>Tokyo Ghoul is not the type of series that attracts any type of audiences. Even people who are into anime would watch it rather reluctantly just to find out that this is actually a very exciting series full of action, drama, and an storyline that will always have you clinging to see the next episode. </p>
<p>The location for this anime is set in Japan in a society where civilians are constantly menaced by the attacks of beings known as <i>Ghouls</i>. In general, these beings pose a significant threat due to the fact that their diet is limited to human beings' flesh and organs. While some of them limit their hunting activity to survival purposes, there are also those who would torture and annihilate humans just for fun.</p>
<p>The protagonist of the series is a guy who many middle-aged males, including myself, might find quite relatable. From a very young age he was left almost completely alone in the world after the passing of his mother. His only remaining relationship is a guy of his same age whose looks, attitude and background constrast significantly with his. While he is a shy, lonely guy who feels more comfortable around small groups of people; his friend is charismatic, full of friends and with a natural talent to gain others' trust.</p>
