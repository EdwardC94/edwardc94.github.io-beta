###What are you going to find here?###

This is a space I'm using to describe myself, express some ideas, but mainly, I'm using this space to learn how to create
responsive websites using the latest in technology.

###"What do you mean by 'the latest in technology'?" you ask###

Thank you for asking, that's a great question. I've made an extensive research on what is it that the experts consider the best
frameworks, libraries, etc for the Web Stack. The results I've found are in no way conclusive, but since Bootstrap, Knockout,
AngularJS, JQuery, Grunt, just to name a few are the ones that iterate; I'll give my best shot at trying and master them.

###The experts###

That's also a good question! MVA courses have been my bread and butter for the last six months. There, I've found that people I
look up to such as: Jon Galloway, Palermo, geektrainer, thebitchwhocodes and Foster recommend some Framworks over others. I've 
learned a lot from them, and here's where I intend to show it.

###My request###

Please, feel free to tell me if I'm doing something wrong or if there's a better way of doing something by pulling a request.
